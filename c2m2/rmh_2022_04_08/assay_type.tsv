OBI:0000615	protein expression profiling assay	An assay that determines protein expression and translation activity using protein extracts collected from a material entity.	["proteomic analysis"]
OBI:0001271	RNA-seq assay	An RNA sequencing assay that determines an RNA sequence by analyzing the transcibed regions of the genome and or to quantitate transcript abundance.	["transcription profiling by high throughput sequencing"]
OBI:0002117	whole genome sequencing assay	A DNA sequencing assay that intends to provide information about the sequence of an entire genome of an organism.	["WGS"]
OBI:0002145	antigen specific antibodies assay	An analyte assay that measures the presence or amount of antibodies to a specified antigen.	[]
OBI:0002623	whole metagenome sequencing assay	A DNA sequencing assay that intends to provide information on the DNA sequences of multiple genomes (a metagenome) from different organisms present in the same input sample.	["WMS"]
OBI:0002760	metatranscriptome sequencing assay	An RNA-seq assay that determines the RNA sequence of microbial transcripts from a microbioal community of mixed species from a given microbiome.	[]
OBI:0002761	lipid profiling assay	An analyte assay assay that detects and identifies lipids resulting from biochemical and cellular metabolism.	["lipidomic assay"]
OBI:0002763	16s ribosomal gene sequencing assay	An amplicon sequencing assay in which the amplicon is derived from universal primers used to amplify the 16S ribosomal RNA gene from isolate bacterial genomic DNA or metagenomic DNA from a microbioal community. Resulting sequences are compared to reference 16S sequence databases to identify or classify bacteria present within a given sample.	["16S rRNA sequencing assay"]
